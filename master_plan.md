---

## Week 1: AWS Core Architecture + Networking (✅ In Progress)
**Concept:** VPC design, CIDR planning, Subnet segmentation, NAT/IGW.
**Lab:** Build a custom 3-Tier VPC (Public/Private/Isolated) with Bastion access via CDK.

---

## Week 2: IAM + Security Architecture
**Concept:** Least Privilege, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Cross-account trust.
**Lab:** Define a strict IAM role hierarchy (Admin, Read-Only, Break-Glass) using Python.

---

## Week 3: Compute Infrastructure + High Availability
**Concept:** EC2 vs Lambda, Load Balancing, Auto-Scaling Groups, Failure Domains.
**Lab:** Deploy a self-healing web fleet that replaces broken servers automatically.

---

## Week 4: Databases + Storage Architecture
**Concept:** RDS (SQL), DynamoDB (NoSQL), S3 Lifecycle policies, Encryption at rest.
**Lab:** Create a specific architecture for a secure Multi-AZ PostgreSQL database with automated backups.

---

## Week 5: Observability + Incident Response
**Concept:** CloudWatch, Structured Logging, Metrics, Alarms.
**Lab:** Build an automated "Watchdog" that detects server failures and triggers alerts.

---

## Week 6: Phase 1 Capstone — The Production Web Platform
**Project:** Integrate Weeks 1–5 into a single deployable stack.
**Deliverable:** A secure, load-balanced web application with full logging and database backend.

---

# 🛡️ PHASE 2: Automation + Security Engineering (Weeks 7–12)
*Goal: Leverage your QA/Paramedic background to build "Safe" systems that self-heal and self-audit.*

---

## Week 7: Security Automation (DevSecOps)
**Concept:** Automated remediation and threat detection.
**Lab:** Write a Python script that hunts for open S3 buckets and automatically locks them.

---

## Week 8: Compliance Automation (NIST Focus)
**Concept:** Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) in the cloud.
**Lab:** Build a scanner that checks your infrastructure against NIST 800-53 controls.

---

## Week 9: Infrastructure CI/CD Pipelines
**Concept:** Continuous Integration/Deployment, GitHub Actions.
**Lab:** Build a pipeline that auto-deploys your infrastructure when you push code to Git.

---

## Week 10: Multi-Account Architecture
**Concept:** Landing Zones, AWS Organizations, account separation (Dev vs. Prod).
**Lab:** Simulate a multi-account environment (Root, Security, Logging, Prod).

---

## Week 11: Disaster Recovery (DR) Engineering
**Concept:** RTO/RPO, Multi-Region failover, Backup strategies.
**Lab:** Simulate a "Region Death" and automate the failover to a backup region.

---

## Week 12: Phase 2 Capstone — The Security Bot
**Project:** "Compliance Automation Platform."
**Deliverable:** A bot that scans AWS resources, flags security risks, and generates a PDF compliance report.

---

# 🤖 PHASE 3: Generative AI + Cloud Integration (Weeks 13–18)
*Goal: Enter high-end engineering. Connect Cloud Infrastructure to LLMs and AI Models.*

---

## Week 13: LLM Fundamentals + Cloud AI
**Concept:** AWS Bedrock, OpenAI API, Vector Databases, RAG.
**Lab:** Build a simple RAG pipeline that can "read" a text document and answer questions.

---

## Week 14: Secure AI Infrastructure
**Concept:** Hosting AI securely. API Gateway, Lambda, Private VPC endpoints.
**Lab:** Build an "Enterprise Secure Chat" backend that runs inside your Private VPC.

---

## Week 15: Healthcare AI Protocol Assistant (The Differentiator)
**Concept:** Domain-specific AI application.
**Lab:** Build an AI tool that ingests medical protocols (PDFs) and answers triage questions reliably.

---

## Week 16: AI Compliance + Guardrails
**Concept:** AI Ethics, Hallucination prevention, PII redaction.
**Lab:** Implement "Guardrails" that prevent the AI from answering dangerous or non-compliant questions.

---

## Week 17: AI Cost Control & Optimization
