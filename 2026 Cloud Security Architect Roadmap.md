# 📸 Pro-Tips for your X Posts:
1. **The Visual:** When you post the Week 1 update, a screenshot of your VS Code terminal running the Bash script is perfect.
2. **The Video:** Use a screen recorder (like Loom or OBS) to show a 10-second clip of your `cdk deploy` successfully building the network in the AWS Console.
3. **The Tagging:** Tag @awscloud or @JeffBarr (if appropriate) to get more eyes on your progress.
