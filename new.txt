Your Branding Strategy
You are not a Junior Developer. You are a Cloud Systems Architect with a background in High-Stakes Operations.

Your Superpower: "I don't just build clouds; I build safe, compliant, and resilient systems for critical environments."




"I am Robert Chich. I am working with Gemini on a 24-week AWS SAA-C03 roadmap.

Project Goal: Build a secure 3-tier VPC for a medical distributor (VitalStream) with strict HIPAA/NIST-800-53 alignment.

Task: Please read CONTEXT.md, 2026 Cloud Security Architect Roadmap.md, and project.antigravity-workspace to initialize your knowledge.

Current Focus: Phase 1, Week 1 (Python to Bash Migration). I have already placed create_medical_vpc.sh and verify_medical_vpc.sh in the directory.

Your Role: Act as my Cloud Engineer and Security Auditor. Before performing any actions, describe what you plan to do. Please verify my existing scripts for syntax errors and suggest one security enhancement.

Are you ready to begin?"

🚀 The 2026 Cloud Security Architect Roadmap (SAA-C03 Focused)
Phase 1: Foundations & Shell Automation (Weeks 1-4)
Goal: Bridge the gap between Cybersecurity theory and Cloud Operations.

Week 1: Python to Bash Migration (The CLI Shift)
The Task: Take a Python script (like your VPC creator) and rewrite it as a Bash script using the aws-cli.

The "How":

Learn the syntax for aws ec2 create-vpc and aws ec2 create-subnet.

Implement "Error Handling": In Bash, check if a command succeeded before running the next one (using if [ $? -eq 0 ]).

Why: Juniors are often asked to run quick "one-liner" fixes. Knowing Bash proves you are comfortable in the Linux terminal.

Week 2: Linux Permissions & Security Auditing
The Task: Use the terminal to audit a Linux EC2 instance.

The "How":

Practice chmod, chown, and viewing system logs in /var/log.

Write a script that searches for failed login attempts in the security logs.

Week 3-4: Networking Fundamentals (SAA-C03 Core)
The Task: Manually build a multi-AZ VPC via the CLI.

The "How":

Focus on CIDR Block math: splitting a /16 into /24 subnets.

Understand the "Flow": Internet Gateway -> Route Table -> Subnet.

Phase 2: Secure Architecture Design (Weeks 5-10)
Goal: Master the "Design Secure Architectures" domain of the SAA-C03.

Week 5-7: Identity & Access Management (IAM)
The Task: Build a "Least Privilege" environment for the Medical Distributor scenario.

The "How":

Create IAM Roles instead of Users.

Write JSON Policies that only allow an EC2 instance to read (not delete) from a specific S3 bucket.

Week 8-10: Data Protection (KMS & Encryption)
The Task: Implement "Encryption at Rest" for Patient Data.

The "How":

Learn to create and rotate KMS keys.

Configure an RDS database to be encrypted and placed in a Private Isolated Subnet.

Phase 3: Resilience & The SAA-C03 Blitz (Weeks 11-16)
Goal: Pass the Certification and understand "High Availability."

Week 11-13: High Availability (Load Balancing & Auto-Scaling)
The Task: Ensure the Medical App never goes down.

The "How":

Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

Set up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) that adds servers automatically if traffic spikes.

Week 14-16: Certification Prep
The Task: Take 3-5 full-length practice exams (Tutorials Dojo or Stephane Maarek).

The "How":

Focus on "Scenario Questions." (e.g., "A company needs a cost-effective way to store data that is rarely accessed...").

Goal: Score 80%+ consistently before scheduling the SAA-C03 exam.

Phase 4: Infrastructure as Code & Portfolio (Weeks 17-24)
Goal: Prove you can do the "Junior Puzzle Piece" work.

Week 17-20: AWS CDK & Python Automation
The Task: Convert your manual builds into Python CDK Stacks.

The "How":

Use the script we wrote today as the baseline.

Learn Modularization: Break your code into a "Network Stack" and a "Security Stack."

Week 21-22: Monitoring & Incident Response
The Task: Set up "Alarms" for your infrastructure.

The "How":

Use CloudWatch to send an email alert if a database connection fails.

Learn VPC Flow Logs to see who is hitting your network (Security Audit).

Week 23-24: The "Final Migration" Project
The Task: Document a "Legacy to Cloud" migration for a medical distributor.

The "How":

Create a GitHub Repository.

Include your CDK code, a README explaining your security choices, and a diagram of the architecture.

Why: This is what you show the hiring manager to prove you aren't just a "cert-holder."

How to implement this plan right now:
GitHub is your "Log Book": Create a repository today called AWS-Journey-2026.

The "One-Hour" Rule: Spend 1 hour on SAA-C03 theory (videos/reading) and 1 hour on "Hands-on" (coding/CLI).

Documentation: After every lab, write 3 sentences on why you built it that way.

Would you like me to provide the specific Bash commands you’ll need for Week 1 to begin converting your VPC Python script?
